This android project is barebone setting up OpenCV 4.10.0 (and other 4.x.y versions) for Android in [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) with Native Development Kit (NDK) support.
[Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk) enables you to implement your [OpenCV](https://opencv.org) image processing pipeline in C++ and call that C++ code from Android Kotlin/Java code through JNI ([Java Native Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Native_Interface)).

This Android application, provides a live camera feed with the ability to dynamically switch between front and back cameras. It includes a custom cvFpsMeter for enhanced text visibility. Also features a basic setup for Android NDK and OpenCV, as well as a CV filter with a toggle button for camera switching.

## How to use this repository

1. [Download and Install Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)

2. [Install NDK and CMake](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/install-ndk.md)

3. Clone this repository as an Android Studio project :
     * In Android Studio, click on `File -> New -> Project from Version Control -> Git`
     * Paste this repository *Github URL*, choose a *project directory* and click next.

4. Install *OpenCV Android release* :
    * Download [OpenCV 4.10.0 Android release](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases/download/4.10.0/opencv-4.10.0-android-sdk.zip) or download latest available Android release on [OpenCV website](https://opencv.org/releases/).
    * Unzip downloaded file and put **OpenCV-android-sdk** directory next your project and rename folder `opencvsdk4100`. If you want to place somewhere else please change path in `settings.gradle`

    * Optional(For linux) you can run setupOpenCV.sh for automatic download and setup gradle file for opencv

5. Sync Gradle and run the application on your Android Device!
